# SNAKE!

This is from scratch recreation of the classic snake game using the HTML `<canvas>` element.

Play it [here](https://daltonjmcgee.github.io/2022-11-20/).

## Features
- Standard Snake rules
  - Each time you 'eat' a 'fruit', your snake grows an extra section.
  - If you touch the edge of the screen, you lose.
  - If your snake loops around on itself, you lose.
- Each time you 'eat' a 'fruit' your snake speeds up slightly.
- Each time you 'eat' a 'fruit' the play area gets smaller (to a limit).

## Known bugs
- The gameplay area is wonky and sometimes you lose if you don't quite touch the edge of the screen
- Sometimes you 'eat' a 'fruit' even if you're a little bit away from it.
